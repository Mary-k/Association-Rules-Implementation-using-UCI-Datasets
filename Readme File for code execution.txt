For question 3 and its subparts all the code are placed in the folder Question3

Note: Sample Output for all programs are appended at the bottom of the code

a)
I have implemented both Fk−1 × F1 and Fk−1 × Fk−1 methods on the car evaluation data set directly
the code is in the file 
"apriori_a_b_car.py"
the link of the dataset is mentioned in each program

After running the program it will ask for path of the dataset which is stored in csv format
you are then prompted to enter the minimum support% then the program populates all the computation it has done

b)
code for a is then further extended to b 
the codes are in the file
"apriori_a_b_car.py" for car evaluation dataset
"apriori_b_contraceptive.py" for contraceptive dataset
"apriori_b_nursery.py" for nursery dataset

the execution instructions are similar to that of a)

c)
code for the above 2 questions id further extended to c
the codes are in the file
"apriori_c_car.py"
"apriori_c_contraceptive.py"
"apriori_c_nursery.py"

similarly as above you just need to enter the support %
then it will give the all maximal and closed frequent itemsets

d) and e)
code for d and e are combined together
the codes are in the file
"apriori_d_e_car.py"
"apriori_d_e_contraceptive.py"
"apriori_d_e_nursery.py"
for executing the programs you need to give the path of the dataset
then give the support %
then you will be asked for 3 values of confidence threshold one by one
after this you will be asked if you want to see all the rules press 1 if yes or any other if no
after that top 10 rules are shown

f)
the same convention for name of file is followed for f
here you will just be asked for support threshold
and then it will show top 10 rules generated b Lift measure
